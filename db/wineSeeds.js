        description: "The Pierre Jourdan Tranquille displays understated elegance. Its beautiful blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay highlights the very best qualities from these noble varieties. The wine’s delicate salmon colour is inherited from the Pinot Noir portion of the blend, which also imparts typical fruit and good acid structure. Chardonnay lends an elegant, palate-coating creaminess, making for a wine that strikes the perfect balance between fruit and acid. The bright and cheerful quality of this wine makes it a stunning lunchtime companion. Pierre Jourdan Tranquille from Haute Cabrière is best enjoyed with grilled asparagus, sushi and salads." },

        description: "As a Cape Blend, the Beyerskloof Synergy is a distinctly South African wine that is very classic in its style. Possessing a deep red colour with a lively ruby red edge, the wine greets the nose with upfront aromas of red fruit and cherries which are subsequently joined by sweet cedar oak aromas. On the palate are ample black fruit flavours on entry, leading to a luscious middle with rounded tannins and a finish that lingers. This blend is perfect with lamb shank, game and stews."
